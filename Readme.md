# SBT721
SBT721 is a unique token standard that introduces the concept of Soulbound tokens. A Soulbound token is a type of token that can only be owned and transferred by a specific address. Once a Soulbound token is created and assigned to an address, it cannot be transferred or owned by any other address.

# Overview
Traditional token standards allow tokens to be freely transferred between addresses, but SBT721 brings a new level of security and control by restricting ownership and transfer to a single designated address. This ensures that the token remains under the control of its rightful owner at all times.

# Features
- **Soulbinding**: Tokens are bound to a specific address upon creation, preventing transfer to any other address.
- **Enhanced Security**: Soulbound tokens provide an additional layer of security by limiting ownership and transfer rights.
- **Immutable Ownership**: Once assigned to an address, the ownership of Soulbound tokens cannot be changed or transferred.
- **Controlled Transactions**: Owners have complete control over their Soulbound tokens, ensuring trust and accountability.
